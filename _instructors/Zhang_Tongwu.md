Dr. Tongwu Zhang received his Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Zhejiang University, China, in June 2012. He conducted part of his doctoral research at the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Science, where he worked on whole-genome assembly and RNA-sequencing analysis. Before joining NCI, he was a visiting scholar at the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Dr. Zhang joined the Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG) as a visiting postdoctoral fellow in July 2012, under the mentorship of Kevin M. Brown, Ph.D. He became a staff scientist in the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch (ITEB) in October 2017.

Dr. Zhang has received numerous awards for his work, including an NCI Directorâ€™s Innovation Award in 2013, a Fellowship Achievement Award for Excellence in 2014, a DCEG Intramural Research Award in 2015, a DCEG Fellow Award for Research Excellence (DFARE) in 2016, a DCEG Outstanding Research Paper by a Staff Scientist distinction in 2019, and a winning entry in the 2016, 2019, and 2020 DCEG Informatics Tool Challenge.

Dr. Zhang's research focuses on analyzing, integrating, and interpreting multi-omics data for both cancer genomic and genetic studies. He leads a study developing a cell-type specific QTL resource of primary melanocytes to characterize melanoma susceptibility loci. He also leads the genomic analyses and develops new bioinformatics tools and pipelines for Sherlock-*Lung*.
