Wei Zhao, Ph.D., joined the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch (ITEB) as a postdoctoral fellow in November 2018 and was promoted to a research fellow in September 2020. Dr. Zhao earned her Ph.D. in bioinformatics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the supervision of Dr. Chuck Perou in 2014. Her doctoral research focused on characterization of the genomic and clinical heterogeneity of breast cancer subtypes using deep- sequencing and microarray.

Prior to joining NCI, Dr. Zhao conducted postdoctoral training in the Department of Systems Biology in MD Anderson Cancer Center for four years. Working with Dr. Gordon Mills and Dr. Han Liang, she identified predictive molecular markers and drug targets for rational combinatorial therapy in gynecologic cancers, and developed computational tools for analysis of proteomic data.

Dr. Zhao is working with Dr. Landi to investigate the etiology and progression of lung cancer in never smokers through a comprehensive genomic analysis and clinical and epidemiologic assessment. Her current research focuses on transcriptomics and tumor microenvironment.
