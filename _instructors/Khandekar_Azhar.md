Azhar Khandekar is a Graduate Partnership Program (GPP) fellow, who is currently completing his degree in the bioinformatics and systems biology Ph.D. program at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). He previously worked at the NIH on integrating DNA methylation and somatic mutation data to study mechanisms of mutagenesis, and he is currently working on analyzing copy number variation and structural variants in normal and tumor genomes.

As a joint ITEB and UCSD doctoral student, he is working on his dissertation research under the supervision of Dr. Landi and Ludmil Alexandrov, Ph.D., UCSD. Mr. Khandekar is interested in integrating large-scale omics datasets to ultimately elucidate the biological mechanisms that drive cancer formation and progression.
