Jian Sang, Ph.D., joined the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch (ITEB) as a postdoctoral fellow in September 2019. Dr. Sang earned his Ph.D. in bioinformatics from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019. Under the mentorship of Professor Zhang Zhang, his doctoral studies focused on public transcriptome and epigenome data integration and analysis.

In ITEB, Dr. Sang works with Dr. Landi and Tongwu Zhang, Ph.D., staff scientist, to investigate lung cancer pathogenesis by deep mining of whole genome/exome sequencing data. Dr. Sang's current research interest focuses on the identification of novel predisposing genomic signals using large-scale population-based genomic data and the exploration of their potential clinical applications.
