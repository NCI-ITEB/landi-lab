    <h2 id="bioinformatics-scientists-in-lung-cancer-genomics-multiple-positions-integrative-tumor-epidemiology-branch">Bioinformatics Scientists in Lung Cancer Genomics (multiple positions), Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch</h2>
<p>Our lab is seeking bioinformatics scientists for contractor and post-doctorate positions. The ITEB mission is to conduct large-scale, international epidemiological research on cancer etiology and progression through integrative analyses of risk factors and tissue profiling to inform prevention and clinical strategies. Learn more about the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/iteb">ITEB program of research</a>.</p>

<h2 id="position-description">Position Description</h2>
<p>The bioinformatics scientists will work closely with Maria Teresa Landi, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator, ITEB and senior advisor for genomic epidemiology, Trans-Divisional Research Program (TDRP), and in collaboration with other principal investigators, senior bioinformaticians and epidemiologists within ITEB, across other branches in DCEG, and external leaders in cancer genomics. Dr. Landi’s research focuses on understanding tumor etiology and evolution for potential translational applications. She leads large-scale multidisciplinary research projects primarily on genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer and melanoma. Dr. Landi pioneers cutting-edge analyses of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data, and integrates molecular data with histological and radiological imaging and clinical and epidemiological data.</p>

<p>Successful candidates have the possibility to work on several exciting lung cancer and melanoma studies:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cancer-cases-controls/eagle-study">EAGLE</a>, a study designed to investigate the genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer in smokers by integrating molecular, environmental, clinical and behavioral data from 2,100 lung cancer cases and 2,120 population-based controls; and</li>
  <li><a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/lung/sherlock-lung-study">Sherlock-Lung</a>, which aims to characterize the genomic and evolutionary landscape of lung cancers in never smokers (LCINS) and to develop an integrated molecular, histological, and radiological classification of these tumors. The target sample size is 2,000 multi-ethnic and geographically diverse LCINS.</li>
  <li>Mapping LCINS incidence rates in the US, integrating information on social features and environmental exposures to uncover LCINS hotspots and possible causes.</li>
  <li>Melanoma studies that aim to uncover genetic susceptibilities to melanoma using  familial lineage tracing from thousands of individuals, as well as worldwide melanoma GWAS data including understudied populations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, as part of Sherlock-Lung we are analyzing deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from &gt;1,400 tumor/normal samples and RNA-seq and methylation tumor/normal data from &gt;1,800 samples in collaboration with genomics leaders worldwide. To further characterize LCINS tumor evolution and cell-of-origin, we are also conducting long-read PacBio HiFi DNA sequencing and single-cell sequencing (for both DNA and RNA) from a subset of normal and tumor samples. By integrating this data with bulk RNA-Seq and WGS data, we aim to characterize LCINS genome and transcriptome at the cellular level, and to investigate evolutionary trajectories by incorporating single-cell approaches. We plan to extend genomics analyses to tumor-adjacent normal lung tissues to shed light on when/how malignant clones are formed and evolve. We are also developing genomic analysis algorithms, pipelines and web-based interactive tools for genomics analyses and data visualization to be shared with the research community.</p>

<p>The bioinformatics scientists will be responsible for performing both standard and complex integrative analyses of large-scale multi-omics data. Related tasks include, but are not limited to, data manipulation, algorithmic implementation, statistical programming, genetic/genomic data analyses, data visualization, manuscript drafting, and presentation of results to the scientific community within and beyond DCEG. This position will also require investigation of publicly available cancer genomic databases and bioinformatics pipelines for different data types, including DNA sequencing, and transcriptome, methylation, and microbiome profiling across a range of tissues and cancer types. In addition, this position includes providing support and expertise in installing, troubleshooting, and running analytical pipelines using open-source scientific software on local high-performance computers as well as Cloud-based platforms.</p>
